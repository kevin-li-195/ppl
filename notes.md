Notes from reading Practical Probabilistic Programming by Avi Pfeffer
=====

- Examining probabilistic models using a proof-tree construct.
    Is this useful? Has this been done? What do we get from this?
    What role would proof search play in such a representation?
- Could we specify a model using types in the same way that
    servant implements their API type? Not quite sure how it's
    done, but I think dependencies could be encoded at the type
    level, and the specific *way* in which some variable depends
    on another could be specified in the type.
